### ``Docker Run`` command</br>


``docker run <image_name>``**this command lets us lunch an instance of any docker image,but sometimes we might want to run the contianer in detached mode (for server and stuff) for that we use ``docker run -d <container_name>.**</br>

**There might be  possible  that we may want to run the running container in interactive mode for that we use** ``docker run -it <container_id> /bin/bash``
